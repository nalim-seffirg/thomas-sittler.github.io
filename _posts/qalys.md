Title: QALYs/$ are mo  re intuitive than $/QALYs.

Cost-effectiveness e stimates are often expressed in $/QALY. As long a s we compare ratios of cost-effectiveness, this is equivelent to QALY/$. 

However, even if we know that we ought to be comparing ratios of cost-effectiveness, our System 1 may sometimes implicitly be using differences (subtractions) of cost-effetiveness. This can lead to problems when using $/QALY which are entirely avoided if we use QALY/$.

Suppose we estimate that Organisation A needs to spend 2$ to produce a QALY while Organisation B spends $10 to produce a QALY, and Organisation C spends $100.
