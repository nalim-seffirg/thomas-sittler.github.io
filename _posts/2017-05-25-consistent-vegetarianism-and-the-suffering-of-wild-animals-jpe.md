A revised version of the <a href="https://thomassittler.wordpress.com/2016/07/04/oxford-uehiro-prize-in-practical-ethics-how-should-vegetarians-actually-live-a-reply-to-xavier-cohen/">essay</a>Â I wrote for the Uehiro Prize has been <a href="http://www.jpe.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/JPE0035-Sittler-3.pdf">published</a> in the Journal of Practical Ethics.


Abstract:

<blockquote>Ethical consequentialist vegetarians believe that farmed animals have lives that are worse than non-existence. In this paper, I sketch out an argument that wild animals have worse lives than farmed animals, and that consistent vegetarians should therefore reduce the number of wild animals as a top priority. I consider objections to the argument, and discuss which courses of action are open to those who accept the argument.</blockquote>
