I made this diagram as an attempted summary of [logical empiricism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language,_Truth,_and_Logic). 

We can then think of various counters to logical empiricism within this framework. For example, Kripke [denies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_posteriori_necessity) the Kantian thesis. In "Two dogmas of empiricism", Quine attacks all three vertices of the golden triangle. I may write a post about these in the future.
