title: "Diagrams of linear regression"
---

I made a big diagram describing some assumptions (MLR1-6) that are used in linear regression. In my diagram, there are five categories (in rectangles with dotted lines) of mathematical facts that follow from different subsets of MLR1-6.

The second diagram gives the asymptotic distribution of the IV estimator.
