Title: Against Splitting

£ Many of us split
Many aspiring effective altruists report splitting their donations between two or more charities. For example [...]. Expected utility reasoning suggests that for small donations, one should never split, and always donate all the money to the organisation with the highest expected cost-effectiveness. So prima facie we should not split. Are there any convincing reasons to split? I review...

£ Arguments for splitting
££ Empirical uncertainty combined with risk aversion
Sometimes people say that they are (very) uncertain about which donation opportunity is best and decided to split for that reason. [examples]. High uncertainty is only a reason to split or diversify if one is risk averse [link to an explanation of risk aversion for beginners]. 

Is it sensible to be risk averse about one's altruistic decisions? [insert Jeff Kauffman argument].

££ Moral uncertainty
Does it make any difference if the uncertainty posited is about morality or our values rather than the facts? In other words, is it reasonable for a risk-neutral donor facing uncertainty to split?

This depends on our general theory for dealing with cases of moral uncertainty. (Will MacAskill has written his thesis on this.) We can start by distinguising moral theories which value acts cardinally (like utilitarianism) from moral theories which only value acts ordinally. The latter category would include theories which only adimit of two possible ranks, permissible and impermissible (like some deontlogical theories), as well as theories with finer-grained ranking.

If the only theories in which you have non-zero credence are cardinal theories, we can simply treat our normative uncertainty like empirical uncertainty, by computing the expected value. (MacAskill argues persuasively against competing proposals like 'my favourite theory' [...]).

If you also hold some credence in merely ordinal theories, 
Let's say we are comparing the following acts:
1. Donate $1000 to charity A
2. 2. Donate $500 to charity A and $500 to charity B.

We can see that the only way for your final act-ranking (after applying your voting rule) to favour (2) is if you have sufficient credence in a moral theory that favours (2) in the first place. In other words, if you have credence in a range of views, which disagree on which non-split donation is best, but which all agree in favouring non-splitting over splitting, then the way you aggregate your moral uncertainty provides no reason to split. [depends a bit on the properties of the voting rule - look this up]

££ Diminishing returns
A good reason to split would be if you face 
££ Cooperation with other donors
££ Remaining open-minded or avoiding confirmation bias
££ Memetic effects


£ Recommendation
Many of us still split our donations while the ostensive reasons we give for doing so are rarely convicing. This suggests that splitting is a deep urge. Perhaps splitting satisfies our desire for a warm glow from giving .... I could speculate explanations for this, but that would be a distraction from my main point). So it may not be realistic to plan to stop splitting altogether. Instead, my recommendation would be to give as much as possible to the recipient with the highest expected value, while satisfying our desire to split with the small remaining part. [important assumption which i need to defend more: the desire to split is scope insensitive].
