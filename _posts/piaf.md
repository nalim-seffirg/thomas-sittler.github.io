What does a causal decision theorist do in the Yankees/Red Sox case with a predictor?



A causal situation fully determines how future outcomes causally depend on your acts. To a first approximation, we can think of it as a list of counterfactuals. 



Without a specified causal situation, causal decision theory is underdetermined. 



In the Rex Sox/Yankess case, what are the causal situatons one might possibly be in? 



A/B causal situation set:

If the Yankees win (0.9), I win £1 if I bet on the Yankees and lose £I bet on the Red Sox. 

If the Red Sox win (0.1), I lose £2 if I bet on the Yankees and win £2 if I bet on the Red Sox. 



C/D Causal situation set:

If I win my bet (p), I win £1 if I bet on the Yankees and win £ 2 if I bet on the Red Sox. 

If I lose my bet (1-p), I lose £ 2 if I bet on the Yankees and lose £ 1 if I bet on the Red Sox.



Regardless of p, I will bet Red Sox here, and I will lose money. So we think the C/D causal siatuation set is bad.



What about the set E/F:

If I bet on the yankees...

If I bet on the Red Sox...



And what is our general theory of which set of causal situations to use?					1
