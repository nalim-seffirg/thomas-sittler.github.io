Why don't more companies use IQ tests? It is highly predictive of job success [see 80k]. A company that did this instead of hiring harvard graduates could get talent on the cheap.



Possible explnanations:

1. Irrationality of some kind

2. 2. Measures of job preformace are inadequate, and having a harvard degree is correlated with other things that bring value to companies (being part of the cultural elite, etc.)

   1.1 No-one knows about this

   1.2 Principal-agent problems: the people making the hiring decisions have incentives other than maximisin job performance.

3. 2.1 externalities: individuals perform highly, but they make their team less effective e.g. they are poorly socialised and a pain to deal with. 

4. 2.2 job performance indicators do not measure importaqnce of connections

What can we learn from the few companies that do use IQ tests?
